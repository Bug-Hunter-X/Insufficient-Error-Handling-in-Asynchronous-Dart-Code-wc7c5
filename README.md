# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart:  inadequate error handling within asynchronous functions.  The example shows a function that fetches data from an API. While it includes a `try-catch` block, the error handling is minimal.  It merely prints the error to the console â€“ unacceptable for production environments.

## The Problem

The `fetchData` function lacks comprehensive error handling.  In a real-world application, this could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. The solution below shows how to improve this.

## Solution

The improved version provides more robust error handling:
- More informative error messages
- Custom exception types for better error classification
- Proper logging mechanism (instead of simply printing to the console)
- Returning errors to the caller using the `Future`'s error handling

This ensures that errors are gracefully handled and can be addressed appropriately, making the application more stable and reliable.
